Dry run & local only release
===========================

In some cases, especially when setting up ``axion-release-plugin`` or experimenting with new features it is desirable
to either avoid modification of repository or to persist changes in local repository only.

Dry run
-------

In dry-run mode, no changes are made to repository. ``axion-release`` still interacts with repository to read things,
but all write operations are mocked and printed out to indicated what *would* happen. To use dry run mode::

    #./gradlew release -Prelease.dryRun
    :verifyRelease
    DRY-RUN: uncommitted changes: true
    Looking for uncommitted changes.. FAILED
    DRY-RUN: ahead of remote: true
    Checking if branch is ahead of remote.. FAILED
    :release
    Creating tag: release-0.8.2
    DRY-RUN: creating tag with name: release-0.8.2
    Pushing all to remote: origin
    DRY-RUN: pushing to remote: origin

Local only
----------

In local only mode any actions that interact with remote are skipped. Local only mode can be switch on either using
command line flag::

    ./gradlew release -Prelease.localOnly

or by altering configuration::

    scmVersion {
        localOnly = true
    }

Flag has precedence over configuration. Local only mode is evaluated lazily, so it can be changed during build.
