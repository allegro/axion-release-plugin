# Overriding version

If you are not happy with version provided by `axion-release` you can
force own version using `release.forceVersion` flag:

    ./gradlew release -Prelease.forceVersion=3.0.0

Forced version is treated as version read from repository, so it still
will go through version [version-decorating](version.md#decorating) process:

    # ./gradlew currentVersion -Prelease.forceVersion=3.0.0
    3.0.0-SNAPSHOT

    # git checkout my-branch

    # ./gradlew currentVersion -Prelease.forceVersion=3.0.0
    3.0.0-my-branch-SNAPSHOT

Empty `release.forceVersion` is ignored.

## Force snapshot version

If you want to override the default snapshot check logic, you can
ask `axion` to generate snapshot version (as if you would have some
committed changes) using `release.forceSnapshot` flag. It's especially
useful with integration with CI servers when you want to ensure that CI
build plans always to produce and publish snapshot artifacts (contrary
to release plans):

    ./gradlew build publish -Prelease.forceSnapshot
