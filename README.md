Releasing versions in Gradle is very different from releasing in Maven. Maven came with
[maven-release-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/) which
did all the dirty work. Gradle has no such tool and probably doesn't need it anyway. Evolution of software craft came
to the point, when we start thinking about SCM as ultimate source of truth about project version. Version should not be
hardcoded in **pom.xml** or **build.gradle**.

**axion-release-plugin** embraces this philosophy. Instead of reading project version from buildfile, it is derived
from nearest tag in SCM (or set to default if nothing was tagged). If current commit is tagged commit, project has
a release version. If there were any commits after last tag, project is in SNAPSHOT version. This very simple and
intuitive philosophy, alongside with [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) rules, makes it a lot easier to manage
project versions along SCM tag versions.

## Basic usage

```
plugins {
    id 'pl.allegro.tech.build.axion-release' version '1.5.0'
}

scmVersion {
    tag {
        prefix = 'my-project-name'
    }
}

project.version = scmVersion.version
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [axion-release read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/docs/axion-release-plugin/en/latest).

## Why write new plugin?

There are a few plugins that try to do the same - question is do we need another one?

* [build-version-plugin](https://github.com/GeoNet/gradle-build-version-plugin/) - plugin that was main source of inspiration, reads build version but lacks release options
* [ari gradle-release-plugin](https://github.com/ari/gradle-release-plugin) - takes only branch/tag name for version
* [townsfolk gradle-release-plugin](https://github.com/townsfolk/gradle-release) - more oldschhol, maven-release-plugin-like approach

What I needed was plugin that exposes version taken from nearest tag (like **build-version-plugin**) which at the same time
will be easily integrated with maven-publish and signing. It also needs to be Continuous Integration-aware.
